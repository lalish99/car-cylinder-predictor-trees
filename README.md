# Car Cylinder Number Predictor using Decision Trees

The purpose of this project is to develop an efficient and accurate decision tree algorithm that can accurately predict the number of cylinders in a car based on its various features. This prediction can be useful in a variety of contexts, such as in the automotive industry for engine design and optimization, as well as in the insurance industry for risk assessment and pricing.

The dataset used for this project consists of various features of a car, such as its horsepower, weight, and acceleration, as well as its number of cylinders. The decision tree algorithm was trained on this dataset using a supervised learning approach, where the algorithm learns to make predictions based on labeled examples.

The decision tree algorithm used in this project is a popular and widely-used machine learning algorithm that recursively splits the dataset based on the most informative feature at each node. This process continues until the algorithm reaches a leaf node, which contains a prediction for the target variable.

The performance of the decision tree algorithm was evaluated using a variety of metrics, including accuracy, and the model proved to get over 90% accuracy with a maximum depth of 5.

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of decision tree algorithms in predicting the number of cylinders in a car based on its various features. This prediction can be useful in a variety of contexts, and the algorithm developed in this project can be further optimized and applied in various industries. Thank you for your attention.
